		<p>1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The hashtag "#TeamBahrain" was created in 2018&nbsp;in response to the statement made by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister that "Every soldier that protects our nation, every police officer that upholds our security and stability, every public and private sector employee that support our national progress – we are all part of #TeamBahrain. Together we can overcome any challenge, under the leadership of HM King Hamad". The hashtag created huge reactions both from the public and private sector alike in support of the statement. #TeamBahrain is a model of private-public collaboration to create solutions for investors and entrepreneurs looking to base their activities in the Kingdom. Whether it's a large multinational.</p>

		Developing Industry<a href="#top" class="backToTop"> back to top</a></h3>
		<p>3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Since 1960, the Kingdom&nbsp;of&nbsp;Bahrain developed an economic diversification strategy that included the establishment of industrial parks that target attracting businesses across several industries such as food and beverages, FMCG, pharmaceutical, aluminium, light engineering, plastics and fiberglass. Currently there are seven designated industrial areas in Bahrain that are owned and managed by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism with a total size of 22&nbsp;million m2.</p>
		<h3 id="fig01">Figure&nbsp;1</h3>
								<p>Map of the 7&nbsp;Industrial Parks</p>
							<img alt="Figure 1" src="./G419 - Images/G419 - Fig. 001.png"><p>3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The history of the industrial parks in Bahrain started with Mina Salman Industrial Park that was established in the 1960s with a total area of 590,950&nbsp;m2 and a direct access to the sea, the park was named after the neighbouring Salman Port and was a prime location for manufacturing companies in addition to logistic companies. Whereas Salman Industrial City is the latest industrial park opened in 2010&nbsp;with a size of 12&nbsp;million sqm and is home to the Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP), Bahrain Investment Wharf (BIW), and the Hidd Industrial Park.</p>
		<h3 id="fig02">Figure&nbsp;2</h3>
								<p>History of Industrial Parks in Bahrain</p>
							<img alt="Figure 2" src="./G419 - Images/G419 - Fig. 002.png"><p>3.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;	There are lands used for industrial purposes that are managed by the private sector. There are also factories located in private estates but licensed by the Ministry.</p>
		<p>3.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain is the home of major industrial projects since the sixties including, for example: Aluminium of Bahrain "ALBA", Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard "ASRY", Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company "GPIC" and Gulf Aluminium Rolling Mill Company "GARMCO", JBF Bahrain W.L.L., Mondelez Bahrain Biscuits W.L.L., Mueller Middle East B.S.C.

		<p>3.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Salman Industrial City is the latest industrial area with a size of 12&nbsp;million m2, and is home to the Bahrain International Investment Park, Bahrain Investment Wharf, and the Hidd Industrial Area.</p>
		<p>3.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Industrialization has formed the backbone of Bahrain's drive for economic diversification for more than four decades. Bahrain's development strategy, Vision 2030, confirmed the importance of the manufacturing sector as a key driver for the diversification process, innovation, and knowledge-based economy.</p>
		<p>3.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain's diversification plans focus on reducing positively correlated volatilities amongst industries, avoiding fluctuation, and attracting some optimal combination of industrial investments in this pursuit.</p>
		<p>3.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Manufacturers operating in Bahrain cover a number of sectors from food and beverage manufacturing to fiberglass production and aluminium downstream industries.</p>
		<p>3.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;	A number of industrial services provided by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism are available online:</p>
		<ol class="alpha-lower">
			<li>
				<p>Industrial License: applications to obtain an industrial licence, to implement an industrial project, to add new industrial activity to the industrial licence, to add a branch to the industrial licence, to conduct an expansion of a plant, or to make any transactions related to an industrial licence.</p>

		Fiscal Policy<a href="#top" class="backToTop"> back to top</a></h3>
		<p>3.17.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Despite positive growth in the non‑oil sector's contribution to GDP, non‑oil government revenues have not kept pace with economic growth leading to successive budget deficits. Recognizing the importance of restructuring Government expenditures and revenues to align with positive economic growth, stabilizing debt and strengthening fiscal sustainability, the Government introduced several initiatives between 2015&nbsp;and 2017. These initiatives were centred around three key priorities: streamlining government expenditure, increasing revenues, and redirecting government subsidies towards eligible citizens.</p>
		<p>3.18.&nbsp;&nbsp;	In late 2018&nbsp;the Government launched the Fiscal Balance Program, which provides a roadmap for addressing Bahrain's fiscal challenges over the medium-term, with the overall objective of achieving a balanced budget by 2022. To achieve this goal, six initiatives were introduced:</p>
		<ol class="alpha-lower">
			<li>
				<p>Reducing government operational expenditure through activating six dedicated Government Task Forces to identify and implement savings and setting criteria for the procurement of standard products and services.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Introducing a voluntary retirement scheme for government employees providing them with the opportunity to contribute to the Kingdom's economic growth through entrepreneurship or participation in the private sector.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Balancing the Electricity and Water Authority's expenditures and revenue.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Streamlining the distribution of cash subsidies to citizens in need.</p>

			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>3.19.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Under these broad targets, the Fiscal Balance Program aims to strengthen the Kingdom's fiscal and economic foundations to ensure the sustainability of resources for future generations, through:</p>
		<ol class="alpha-lower">
			<li>
				<p>further developing the provision of sustainable government services in education, health, and social services;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>continuing the provision of subsidized electricity and water services to citizens in their primary residences;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>creating quality job opportunities for citizens and ample support to business;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>establishing rules for the sustainable use of resources;</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>improving Bahrain's credit rating, thereby reducing the cost of financing for citizens and investors.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>3.20.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Both the 2019-20&nbsp;and 2021-22&nbsp;state budgets demonstrate that Bahrain is prioritizing sound fiscal and economic policies while safeguarding the continued prosperity of citizens and reflects the Kingdom's continued commitment to achieving the Fiscal Balance Program targets. The budget has envisaged a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit, as the government non‑interest expenditure remains under tight control while continuing to improve the quality and efficiency of the government services. Also, a new taskforce focusing on non‑oil revenue development was created to review existing fees and generate new revenue streams without overburdening the economy; this is expected to further drive the Kingdom's economic diversification and enhance the role of the private sector.</p>
		<p>3.21.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain in 2015, under the guidance of the His Royal Highness Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander and Prime Minister, started a fellowship programme meant to further bolstering national skills and capabilities to support the Kingdom's programme of sustainable development. The significant amount of applications to the fellowship programme reflected the commitment of Bahraini youth to further develop their skill sets and to capitalize on opportunities that facilitate the development of their performance. The fellowship programme became at the forefront of government development programmes and contributes to increasing the proficiency of the national workforce through improving the leadership and analytical skills of the fellows.</p>
		<p>3.22.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Now Bahrain is at the sixth intake of the Prime Minister's Fellowship Programme, which highlights the importance of investing in the Kingdom's citizens to secure sustainable economic development. The youth of Bahrain play a significant role towards realizing the goals of the Kingdom's comprehensive development. Advancing the capabilities of government employees is a central goal that will be continued throughout all strategic development plans in Bahrain. The achievements of Bahrainis across various government agencies became visible, and support will continue to be provided to further enhance the capabilities of Bahrainis, which contribute towards the Government's overall development.</p>
		<p>3.23.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Participants are selected following a rigorous evaluation process and take part in a yearlong programme, which aims to further hone their professional development and leadership skills across areas of public service. the Fellowship's administrators are committed to modernize the programme's initiatives and ensure the returning fellows apply the knowledge they have retained during the program upon their return to their workplaces.</p>

		<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The structure of the Bahraini economy has been transformed by a rapid process of economic diversification since the turn of the century. While the share of the hydrocarbons sector (crude oil and natural gas) more than halved in relative terms from 43.6% to 18.6% of GDP between 2000&nbsp;and 2020, all other sectors with the exception of real estate have shown an increasing contribution to Bahrain's GDP.</p>
		<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	In terms of each sector's contribution to GDP during 2020, the Financial Services sector remains the largest non‑oil sector, contributing 17.9% to the GDP, followed by the manufacturing sector (14.3%) and the government services sector (12.9%).</p>

		<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	According to preliminary GDP results for Q1 2021, Bahrain's economy witnessed growth in nominal terms of 0.3% on an annual basis and 1.5% on a quarterly basis, while real GDP registered a drop of 2.1% on an annual basis and remained consistent on a quarterly basis with a slight drop of 0.1% compared to the previous quarter. Sector performance in Q1 2021&nbsp;reflected signs of recovery with the ongoing efforts to counter the effects of the pandemic, especially with the extension of various support initiatives under the Stimulus Package and the successful vaccination campaign run by the Kingdom. The transport and communications sector led the way in terms of quarterly growth, with a 6.5% nominal growth and 8.2% real growth. By contrast, the hotels and restaurants sector is still hampered by the effects of the pandemic registering the biggest annually decline.</p>
		<h3 id="sec4.2">4.2. 
		Financial services<a href="#top" class="backToTop"> back to top</a></h3>
		<p>4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The financial services sector is one of Bahrain's strongest assets. Not only does it contribute heavily to the country's GDP, but it is also one of the most important employers in the economy, providing around 13,737&nbsp;jobs, with the highest average wage of any sector.</p>
		<p>4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;	In 2020, the financial sector represented 17.9% of real GDP. There is a growing market demand for financial services and products, particularly for Islamic financial instruments. The Bahrain Financial Harbour and the Bahrain World Trade Centre, and Bahrain Bay along are some of the witnessed projects that have successfully developed since 2005.</p>
		<p>4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain is currently home to 370&nbsp;financial institutions (as of December 2020), with total Banking Assets of USD&nbsp;207.4&nbsp;billion at December 2020.</p>
		<p>4.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain has become host to the largest number of Islamic banks in the world, as well as a growing support industry. There are 46&nbsp;Islamic financial institutions, which includes banks, insurance companies and investment funds.</p>
		<p>4.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Insurance is a well-developed industry in Bahrain (11&nbsp;foreign insurance firms, 22&nbsp;locally incorporated insurance firms.), and has an important growth potential.</p>
		<p>4.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;	As part of the Central Bank of Bahrain's ongoing initiatives towards financial digital transformation in the Kingdom and developments in digital financial services, the CBB established a dedicated Fintech &amp; Innovation Unit to ensure that best services are provided to individual and corporate customers in the financial services sector by encouraging an agile regulatory framework that fosters FinTech and innovation.</p>
		<p>4.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;	This follows the CBB's other initiatives, which include introducing a Regulatory Sandbox that will allow startups, FinTech firms and licensees to provide innovative banking and financial solutions, in addition to the issuance of a host of new regulations such as but not limited to, crowdfunding regulations, open banking regulations, cryptoasset regulations for both conventional and Sharia-compliant services.</p>
		<p>4.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The CBB's FinTech &amp; Innovation Unit is also responsible for the approval process to participate in the Regulatory Sandbox, supervision of authorized Sandbox companies' testing progress, monitoring technical and regulatory developments in the FinTech field, both regionally and internationally, to lead on strategic FinTech initiatives and to work closely with all stakeholders within the FinTech ecosystem in the Kingdom and to collaborate with regulators regionally and internationally to share experiences and learnings and to embark on cross-border trials.</p>
		<p>4.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;	FinHub 973, by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), is the region's first cross-border, digital innovation platform that connects and facilitates collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech's under the supervision of the central bank. Powered by Fintech Galaxy, FinHub 973&nbsp;enables local and global fintech's to connect seamlessly with Bahrain's financial institutions for exploring, testing, and prototyping on a centralised digital sandbox. FinHub973&nbsp;integrates the technical testing and validation of digital solutions with the regulatory framework of the CBB. The platform also showcases qualified FinTech's for collaboration, procurement, partnerships, and investment within Bahrain's ecosystem, while also interfacing with regulatory authorities to facilitate quicker and easier regulatory testing and supporting business scalability.</p>
		<p>4.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) was formerly launched in January 2019&nbsp;by an international group of financial regulators and related organisations, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This built on the FCA's early 2018&nbsp;proposal to create a global sandbox. The GFIN is a network of 60&nbsp;organizations committed to supporting financial innovation in the interests of consumers. The CBB is a member of the 'Co-ordination Group' within GFIN, which is the highest tier of membership.</p>
		<p>4.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The GFIN seeks to provide a more efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, helping them navigate between countries as they look to scale new ideas. This includes a pilot for firms wishing to test innovative products, services, or business models across more than one jurisdiction. It also aims to create a new framework for cooperation between financial services regulators on innovation related topics, sharing different experiences and approaches.</p>
		<p>4.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain is recognized as the global leader in Islamic finance, ranking 1st in MENA and 2nd globally for Islamic finance development (ICD&nbsp;2019). We set the benchmark early for Islamic banking regulation by establishing the Bahrain Islamic Bank in 1978, and have nurtured the concepts, rules, and standards of Shari'a banking compliance in Islamic banks ever since. In this way, we are able to cater to the needs of both mainstream Islamic finance and the new breed of FinTech entrepreneurs who offer Shari'a-compliant products. Our continued focus on innovation and customer service has made Bahrain a top destination for Islamic finance development.</p>
		<p>4.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain has the highest concentration of Islamic finance institutions in the region: 10&nbsp;wholesale Islamic banks and six&nbsp;retail Islamic banks. A highly connected ecosystem, our expertise spans every area of Islamic financing, from asset management and Sukuk issuance to Shari'a-compliant insurance and reinsurance.</p>
		<p>4.17.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain, currently home to six&nbsp;Takaful firms and two&nbsp;Retakaful firms, is the ideal jurisdiction for the industry. The Central Bank of Bahrain has also implemented the new Takaful model which enhances solvency status assessment of these firms. Total Islamic banking assets held in Bahrain stood at USD&nbsp;31.6&nbsp;billion in 2020, making it one of the region's largest Islamic finance and banking markets. The Central Bank of Bahrain is continuously implementing new initiatives and policy tools to further develop Bahrain's standing in Islamic finance, most recently: a new Takaful model and a new Shari'a-compliant Wakalah investment tool.</p>
		<p>4.18.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Bahrain is home to several international financial institutions, for example American Express Middle East, HSBC, Citibank, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, State Bank of India, among others.</p>
		<p>4.19.&nbsp;&nbsp;	FinTech, the intersection of finance and technology, is experiencing unprecedented industry growth across the globe, none more so than in the Middle East. At the heart of this digital transformation, Bahrain is continually evolving its long-established financial services ecosystem to unlock opportunities for FinTech ventures and global financial institutions with a digital agenda. Bahrain is home to MENA's leading FinTech hub, Bahrain FinTech Bay, which provides facilities including dedicated coworking, innovation labs, advisory services, and collaboration platforms.</p>
