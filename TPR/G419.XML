						<title>Developing Industry</title>
						<p>3.6.  	Since 1960, the Kingdom of Bahrain developed an economic diversification strategy that included the establishment of industrial parks that target attracting businesses across several industries such as food and beverages, FMCG, pharmaceutical, aluminium, light engineering, plastics and fiberglass. Currently there are seven designated industrial areas in Bahrain that are owned and managed by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism with a total size of 22 million m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

						<p>3.7.  	The history of the industrial parks in Bahrain started with Mina Salman Industrial Park that was established in the 1960s with a total area of 590,950 m<sup>2</sup> and a direct access to the sea, the park was named after the neighbouring Salman Port and was a prime location for manufacturing companies in addition to logistic companies. Whereas Salman Industrial City is the latest industrial park opened in 2010 with a size of 12 million sqm and is home to the Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP), Bahrain Investment Wharf (BIW), and the Hidd Industrial Park.</p>

						<title>Fiscal Policy</title>
						<p>3.17.  	Despite positive growth in the non‑oil sector's contribution to GDP, non‑oil government revenues have not kept pace with economic growth leading to successive budget deficits. Recognizing the importance of restructuring Government expenditures and revenues to align with positive economic growth, stabilizing debt and strengthening fiscal sustainability, the Government introduced several initiatives between 2015 and 2017. These initiatives were centred around three key priorities: streamlining government expenditure, increasing revenues, and redirecting government subsidies towards eligible citizens.</p>
						<p>3.18.  	In late 2018 the Government launched the Fiscal Balance Program, which provides a roadmap for addressing Bahrain's fiscal challenges over the medium-term, with the overall objective of achieving a balanced budget by 2022. To achieve this goal, six initiatives were introduced:</p>
						<list id="L6" list-type="alpha-lower">
							<list-item>
								<label>a</label>
								<p>Reducing government operational expenditure through activating six dedicated Government Task Forces to identify and implement savings and setting criteria for the procurement of standard products and services.</p>
							</list-item>
							<list-item>
								<label>b</label>
								<p>Introducing a voluntary retirement scheme for government employees providing them with the opportunity to contribute to the Kingdom's economic growth through entrepreneurship or participation in the private sector.</p>

						<p>3.20.  	Both the 2019-20 and 2021-22 state budgets demonstrate that Bahrain is prioritizing sound fiscal and economic policies while safeguarding the continued prosperity of citizens and reflects the Kingdom's continued commitment to achieving the Fiscal Balance Program targets. The budget has envisaged a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit, as the government non‑interest expenditure remains under tight control while continuing to improve the quality and efficiency of the government services. Also, a new taskforce focusing on non‑oil revenue development was created to review existing fees and generate new revenue streams without overburdening the economy; this is expected to further drive the Kingdom's economic diversification and enhance the role of the private sector.</p>
						<p>3.21.  	Bahrain in 2015, under the guidance of the His Royal Highness Crown Prince, Deputy Supreme Commander and Prime Minister, started a fellowship programme meant to further bolstering national skills and capabilities to support the Kingdom's programme of sustainable development. The significant amount of applications to the fellowship programme reflected the commitment of Bahraini youth to further develop their skill sets and to capitalize on opportunities that facilitate the development of their performance. The fellowship programme became at the forefront of government development programmes and contributes to increasing the proficiency of the national workforce through improving the leadership and analytical skills of the fellows.</p>
						<p>3.22.  	Now Bahrain is at the sixth intake of the Prime Minister's Fellowship Programme, which highlights the importance of investing in the Kingdom's citizens to secure sustainable economic development. The youth of Bahrain play a significant role towards realizing the goals of the Kingdom's comprehensive development. Advancing the capabilities of government employees is a central goal that will be continued throughout all strategic development plans in Bahrain. The achievements of Bahrainis across various government agencies became visible, and support will continue to be provided to further enhance the capabilities of Bahrainis, which contribute towards the Government's overall development.</p>
						<p>3.23.  	Participants are selected following a rigorous evaluation process and take part in a yearlong programme, which aims to further hone their professional development and leadership skills across areas of public service. the Fellowship's administrators are committed to modernize the programme's initiatives and ensure the returning fellows apply the knowledge they have retained during the program upon their return to their workplaces.</p>

						<p>4.1.  	The structure of the Bahraini economy has been transformed by a rapid process of economic diversification since the turn of the century. While the share of the hydrocarbons sector (crude oil and natural gas) more than halved in relative terms from 43.6% to 18.6% of GDP between 2000 and 2020, all other sectors with the exception of real estate have shown an increasing contribution to Bahrain's GDP.</p>
						<p>4.2.  	In terms of each sector's contribution to GDP during 2020, the Financial Services sector remains the largest non‑oil sector, contributing 17.9% to the GDP, followed by the manufacturing sector (14.3%) and the government services sector (12.9%).</p>

						<p>4.3.  	According to preliminary GDP results for Q1 2021, Bahrain's economy witnessed growth in nominal terms of 0.3% on an annual basis and 1.5% on a quarterly basis, while real GDP registered a drop of 2.1% on an annual basis and remained consistent on a quarterly basis with a slight drop of 0.1% compared to the previous quarter. Sector performance in Q1 2021 reflected signs of recovery with the ongoing efforts to counter the effects of the pandemic, especially with the extension of various support initiatives under the Stimulus Package and the successful vaccination campaign run by the Kingdom. The transport and communications sector led the way in terms of quarterly growth, with a 6.5% nominal growth and 8.2% real growth. By contrast, the hotels and restaurants sector is still hampered by the effects of the pandemic registering the biggest annually decline.</p>

						<title>Financial services</title>
						<p>4.4.  	The financial services sector is one of Bahrain's strongest assets. Not only does it contribute heavily to the country's GDP, but it is also one of the most important employers in the economy, providing around 13,737 jobs, with the highest average wage of any sector.</p>
						<p>4.5.  	In 2020, the financial sector represented 17.9% of real GDP. There is a growing market demand for financial services and products, particularly for Islamic financial instruments. The Bahrain Financial Harbour and the Bahrain World Trade Centre, and Bahrain Bay along are some of the witnessed projects that have successfully developed since 2005.</p>
						<p>4.6.  	Bahrain is currently home to 370 financial institutions (as of December 2020), with total Banking Assets of USD 207.4 billion at December 2020.</p>
						<p>4.7.  	Bahrain has become host to the largest number of Islamic banks in the world, as well as a growing support industry. There are 46 Islamic financial institutions, which includes banks, insurance companies and investment funds.</p>
						<p>4.8.  	Insurance is a well-developed industry in Bahrain (11 foreign insurance firms, 22 locally incorporated insurance firms.), and has an important growth potential.</p>
						<p>4.9.  	As part of the Central Bank of Bahrain's ongoing initiatives towards financial digital transformation in the Kingdom and developments in digital financial services, the CBB established a dedicated Fintech &#x0026; Innovation Unit to ensure that best services are provided to individual and corporate customers in the financial services sector by encouraging an agile regulatory framework that fosters FinTech and innovation.</p>
						<p>4.10.  	This follows the CBB's other initiatives, which include introducing a Regulatory Sandbox that will allow startups, FinTech firms and licensees to provide innovative banking and financial solutions, in addition to the issuance of a host of new regulations such as but not limited to, crowdfunding regulations, open banking regulations, cryptoasset regulations for both conventional and Sharia-compliant services.</p>
						<p>4.11.  	The CBB's FinTech &#x0026; Innovation Unit is also responsible for the approval process to participate in the Regulatory Sandbox, supervision of authorized Sandbox companies' testing progress, monitoring technical and regulatory developments in the FinTech field, both regionally and internationally, to lead on strategic FinTech initiatives and to work closely with all stakeholders within the FinTech ecosystem in the Kingdom and to collaborate with regulators regionally and internationally to share experiences and learnings and to embark on cross-border trials.</p>
						<p>4.12.  	FinHub 973, by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), is the region's first cross-border, digital innovation platform that connects and facilitates collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech's under the supervision of the central bank. Powered by Fintech Galaxy, FinHub 973 enables local and global fintech's to connect seamlessly with Bahrain's financial institutions for exploring, testing, and prototyping on a centralised digital sandbox. FinHub973 integrates the technical testing and validation of digital solutions with the regulatory framework of the CBB. The platform also showcases qualified FinTech's for collaboration, procurement, partnerships, and investment within Bahrain's ecosystem, while also interfacing with regulatory authorities to facilitate quicker and easier regulatory testing and supporting business scalability.</p>
						<p>4.13.  	The Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN) was formerly launched in January 2019 by an international group of financial regulators and related organisations, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This built on the FCA's early 2018 proposal to create a global sandbox. The GFIN is a network of 60 organizations committed to supporting financial innovation in the interests of consumers. The CBB is a member of the 'Co-ordination Group' within GFIN, which is the highest tier of membership.</p>
						<p>4.14.  	The GFIN seeks to provide a more efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, helping them navigate between countries as they look to scale new ideas. This includes a pilot for firms wishing to test innovative products, services, or business models across more than one jurisdiction. It also aims to create a new framework for cooperation between financial services regulators on innovation related topics, sharing different experiences and approaches.</p>
						<p>4.15.  	Bahrain is recognized as the global leader in Islamic finance, ranking 1<sup>st</sup> in MENA and 2<sup>nd</sup> globally for Islamic finance development (ICD 2019). We set the benchmark early for Islamic banking regulation by establishing the Bahrain Islamic Bank in 1978, and have nurtured the concepts, rules, and standards of Shari'a banking compliance in Islamic banks ever since. In this way, we are able to cater to the needs of both mainstream Islamic finance and the new breed of FinTech entrepreneurs who offer Shari'a-compliant products. Our continued focus on innovation and customer service has made Bahrain a top destination for Islamic finance development.</p>
						<p>4.16.  	Bahrain has the highest concentration of Islamic finance institutions in the region: 10 wholesale Islamic banks and six retail Islamic banks. A highly connected ecosystem, our expertise spans every area of Islamic financing, from asset management and Sukuk issuance to Shari'a-compliant insurance and reinsurance.</p>
						<p>4.17.  	Bahrain, currently home to six Takaful firms and two Retakaful firms, is the ideal jurisdiction for the industry. The Central Bank of Bahrain has also implemented the new Takaful model which enhances solvency status assessment of these firms. Total Islamic banking assets held in Bahrain stood at USD 31.6 billion in 2020, making it one of the region's largest Islamic finance and banking markets. The Central Bank of Bahrain is continuously implementing new initiatives and policy tools to further develop Bahrain's standing in Islamic finance, most recently: a new Takaful model and a new Shari'a-compliant Wakalah investment tool.</p>
						<p>4.18.  	Bahrain is home to several international financial institutions, for example American Express Middle East, HSBC, Citibank, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, State Bank of India, among others.</p>
						<p>4.19.  	FinTech, the intersection of finance and technology, is experiencing unprecedented industry growth across the globe, none more so than in the Middle East. At the heart of this digital transformation, Bahrain is continually evolving its long-established financial services ecosystem to unlock opportunities for FinTech ventures and global financial institutions with a digital agenda. Bahrain is home to MENA's leading FinTech hub, Bahrain FinTech Bay, which provides facilities including dedicated coworking, innovation labs, advisory services, and collaboration platforms.</p>
						<p>4.20.  	The transformation of Bahrain's FinTech ecosystem has been driven by unmatched regulatory reform, paving the way for emerging industries including crowdfunding, InsurTech, robo-advice and crypto-asset platforms. The Central Bank of Bahrain is continuously reforming policies to enhance the activity, funding, quality, and competitiveness of financial sector services.</p>
						<p>4.21.  	In 2016, The Central Bank of Bahrain pioneered a regulatory sandbox that allows FinTech firms and digitally focused financial institutions around the world to test new products and services in Bahrain. Since its inception, the sandbox has nurtured a number of innovative FinTech businesses, including the Middle East's first licensed cryptocurrency exchange Rain.</p>
						<p>4.22.  	The Central Bank of Bahrain introduced crowdfunding regulation to enable the establishment and growth of equity, debt-based and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bahrainedb.com/business-opportunities/financial-services/fintech-and-payments/">Shariah-compliant</ext-link> crowdfunding activity.</p>
						<p>4.23.  	Bahrain's highly connected economy and young, digitally adept population make it the perfect testbed for financial tech startups and scale-ups to launch, gain funding and expand into regional and even global markets.</p>

Accordingly, Bahrain's trade policy objectives are to ensure a fair and predictable international trading environment; allowing liberal access to international markets for its exports and minimize impediments to the flow of imports.</p>
						<p>5.2.  	These goals are pursued through the sustained maintenance and enlargement of Bahrain's adherence and engagement with its trading partners multilaterally, regionally, and bilaterally. This would also contribute to the attainment of the long-term objectives of Bahrain's Economic Vision 2030, which aims for attaining sustainable development by moving towards economic diversification to increase economic viability; raise productivity levels and enhance Bahraini competitiveness as a knowledge-based economy.</p>
						<p>5.3.  	At a very top level we strive to achieve our business-friendly aspiration by continuously working to reduce red-tape and creating an environment that makes it as easy as possible to invest and grow your business.</p>
						<p>5.4.  	Bahrain has a liberal business environment – that offers 100% foreign ownership, coupled with comparatively lower operating costs as currently the cost of running a business in Bahrain is approximately comparatively 30% lower than other regional centres.</p>
						<p>5.5.  	Import trade enjoys duty-free entry for basic raw materials, industrial inputs, and spare parts.</p>
						<p>5.6.  	Bahrain's trading environment is stable and transparent. There are no import restrictions except for patrimonial heritage, environmental, health or security considerations.</p>
						<p>5.7.  	There is a continuous discussion between the different government entities and the private sector whereby consultations are undertaken on how to improve and develop the services provided to further enhance the development of Bahrain's economy which stems from the firm belief that the Government is a regulatory entity and that the economy is driven by the private sector.</p>
