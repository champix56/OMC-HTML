		INTRODUCTORY REMARKS BY THE CHAIRPERSON</h2>
		<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Good afternoon and welcome to this meeting of the TPRB, which was convened by Airgram WTO/AIR/TPR/120&nbsp;on 22&nbsp;November&nbsp;2021.</p>
		<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The purpose of this meeting is for Members and Observers of the Trade Policy Review Body to undertake their annual overview of developments in the international trading environment which are having an impact on the multilateral trading system, as provided in Paragraph G of Annex 3&nbsp;of the Marrakesh Agreement.</p>
		<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	As mentioned in the Airgram, today's discussion is assisted by the Director-General's Annual Report which provides a comprehensive overview of the overall state of global trade, of significant developments in the implementation of trade policies by WTO&nbsp;Members and Observers, and an up-date on several trade policy issues affecting the trading system for the period between mid-October 2020&nbsp;and mid-October 2021.</p>
		<p>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;	This Report has also been produced in the context of the COVID‑19&nbsp;pandemic, and the recent emergence of a new variant, causing the postponement of the MC12&nbsp;were stark reminders that we live in precarious and uncertain times. Against this backdrop, the ramifications of the pandemic - on trade as well as more broadly on the global economy, are covered extensively in the Report.</p>
		<p>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Report was circulated in document WT/TPR/OV/24&nbsp;on 22&nbsp;November&nbsp;2021.</p>
		<p>1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Let me briefly recall the purpose of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, which according to Annex 3&nbsp;of the Marrakesh Agreement, is to achieve greater transparency in, and understanding of, Members' trade and trade-related policies and measures. The TPRM is not intended to serve as a basis for the enforcement of obligations under WTO Agreements, for dispute-settlement purposes or to impose new policy commitments on Members.</p>
		<p>1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;	These same fundamental principles apply to the periodic reports by the Director-General - such as the Annual Report presented today. The trade monitoring exercise is, above all, a transparency exercise. It is intended to be purely factual and has no legal effect on the rights and obligations of WTO&nbsp;Members.</p>
		<p>1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;	As you know, the preparation of these reports relies on Members' timely and specific inputs to the trade monitoring exercise as well as on their notifications under the various WTO Agreements. For the current Report, 60% of the Membership provided input, representing around 94% of world trade.</p>
		<p>1.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;	I do not wish to go into detail about the substantive findings of the Director-General's Report. It speaks for itself, and I will shortly invite Director-General Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to present the Report and share her views. Before I do so, allow me to make a few observations.</p>
		<p>1.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Report found that there has been encouraging news for a post-pandemic recovery over the period covered, although the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain. As we know, the recovery is uneven across regions. Nevertheless, the multilateral trading system has shown resilience and played an instrumental role in encouraging restraint in the implementation of trade-restrictive measures.</p>
		<p>1.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;	I believe that the findings of the Report, while positive in terms of the world trade and economic growth, also reminds us of the fundamental challenges towards ensuring a sustainable recovery, including equitable access to COVID‑19&nbsp;vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although immediately after the outbreak of the pandemic Members implemented many measures which restricted the flow of trade, today we see a different and more positive picture.</p>
		<p>1.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;	For example, of the 399&nbsp;COVID‑19&nbsp;trade related measures recorded since the outbreak of the pandemic, 66% were of a facilitating nature and 34% were restrictive. Generally, Members have shown commitment to providing transparency on these measures and, importantly, to rolling them back when no longer needed.</p>
		<p>1.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Report shows that, as at mid-October 2021, 205&nbsp;COVID‑19&nbsp;related trade-facilitating measures with an estimated trade coverage of USD&nbsp;112&nbsp;billion were still in force compared to 56&nbsp;restrictive measures, with an estimated trade coverage of USD&nbsp;92&nbsp;billion. Therefore, it is important to note that the trade coverage of the COVID‑19&nbsp;facilitating measures still in place is significantly larger than that of restrictive ones.</p>
		<p>1.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;	At the same time, the monitoring of non‑COVID‑19&nbsp;trade measures reveals that fewer restrictions were put in place during this period. However, the stockpile of previous trade restrictions which are still in place remains large.</p>
		<p>1.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Overall, I believe the Report provides us with a very important and useful snapshot of the latest developments in the implementation of trade policies – specifically in relation to the pandemic, but also more broadly. Providing this kind of transparency is what the trade monitoring mechanism is about and hopefully that is helpful to the Membership.</p>
		<p>1.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Now, let me give the floor to the DG to introduce this Report. Subsequently, I will open the floor for comments from delegations.</p>
		<h2 id="sec2">2. 
		INTRODUCTORY REMARKS BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL</h2>
		<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	I am pleased to join you today to take stock of recent trade policy developments.</p>
		<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	You all will have seen my Report which was circulated to Members on 22&nbsp;November, in document WT/TPR/OV/24.</p>
		<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	I won't go through the main findings of the Report in great detail. Ambassador Molokomme has already alluded to many of them, and you have no doubt looked at the report yourselves.</p>
		<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;	There are a few figures I want to highlight. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, WTO&nbsp;Members and Observers have implemented 399&nbsp;COVID‑19&nbsp;trade and trade-related measures on goods. Of these, 262 (66%) were of a trade facilitating nature and 137 (34%) could be considered trade restrictive. In other words, trade-facilitating measures outnumbered trade-restrictive ones by nearly two to one. This is positive.</p>
		<p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Of the restrictive measures recorded, 85% of them – that is, 117&nbsp;measures, have been export restrictions. Although almost 60% of these had been repealed as of mid-October 2021, 45&nbsp;export restrictions are still in place targeting products such as medicines, other medical supplies, and personal protective equipment. I urge Members to roll back these restrictions as soon as possible as they may be hampering the COVID‑19&nbsp;response, including vaccine production and deployment. I may also add that there are still some import restrictive measures related to the pandemic.</p>
		<p>2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Some of the trade-facilitating measures - around 22% of them – have also been unwound.</p>
		<p>2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;	All told, the value of traded goods covered by the 205&nbsp;COVID‑19&nbsp;trade-facilitating measures still in place as of mid-October 2021&nbsp;was estimated at USD&nbsp;112.1&nbsp;billion while the trade coverage of the 56&nbsp;trade-restrictive measures stood at USD&nbsp;92.3&nbsp;billion.</p>
		<p>2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;	While the report focuses primarily on goods trade, it also finds that 138&nbsp;of the 153&nbsp;reported pandemic-related measures affecting services trade remain in force. Most of these appear to be trade-facilitating with an eye to minimizing supply chain disruptions, such as quicker entry processes for transport personnel and business travellers. Despite such efforts, services trade has been slower to recover than goods trade, in part due to weak demand and continued limitations on travel and tourism.</p>
		<p>2.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;	When it comes to the monitoring of trade measures not directly related to the COVID‑19&nbsp;pandemic, the Report reveals that Members and Observers put fewer restrictions in place between October 2020&nbsp;and October 2021&nbsp;compared to previous review periods. Nevertheless, the stockpile of trade restrictions introduced but unrepealed since 2009&nbsp;has continued to grow, and now covers traded merchandise worth an estimated USD&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;trillion, or close to 9% of world imports as at mid-October 2021. This steady accumulation of trade restrictions should be of concern to all of us.</p>
		<h2 id="sec3">3. 
		THE REPORT</h2>
		<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	First, the Report shows that trade has been central to combatting the pandemic, and that the multilateral trading system has played an instrumental role in encouraging restraint in the use of trade restrictions in response to the shocks arising from COVID‑19.</p>
		<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	As we know, the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain. The postponement of MC12&nbsp;as a result of the new Omicron variant was certainly a stark and disappointing reminder of that.</p>
		<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The monitoring report makes clear that the multilateral trading system has been, and continues to be, an important factor in our response to the pandemic. It makes clear how WTO Committees have continued operating throughout the health crisis to service Members. But we also know that trade and the WTO can and must do more to foster production of, and equitable access to, sufficient quantities of COVID‑19&nbsp;vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. This is why I have urged Members to reach an agreement on pandemic response, including intellectual property issues, by the end of February. As Dr Tedros said the other day "We may be done with COVID, but COVID is not done with us". Future pandemics are almost certain to emerge as well – and we owe it to the people we serve, and to future generations, to ensure the WTO makes its full contribution to preparedness and response and the national and global levels.</p>
		<p>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Second, this trade monitoring exercise has since day one been about transparency and predictability – about collaborating with you, the Members, to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence in how markets are operating. This is one of the WTO's core functions to support our Members, and it also matters for businesses and consumers. When the pandemic hit in early 2020, we all had to adjust and adapt, and for the WTO&nbsp;Secretariat, part of this meant using the trade monitoring exercise, with its familiar verification mechanism, to report on the developments with regard to trade measures taken in response to the crisis.</p>
		<p>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Third, while it is true that this multilateral and cross-cutting transparency exercise is only as strong as Members want it to be, I believe credit is due to delegations for your collaboration with this exercise. But like Oliver Twist, I always ask for more – so I will say that with your support we can do better, and echo Ambassador Molokomme on the importance of getting more Members involved in trade monitoring.</p>
		<p>3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Since this exercise started in 2009, it has become an important factual transparency tool for Members. As you are aware, the contents of this Report have no legal effect on the rights and obligations of WTO&nbsp;Members. The Report does not question the explicit right of Members to adopt certain trade measures.</p>
		<p>3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;	I will stop here. I look forward to hearing delegations exchange views on the findings of the Report.</p>

		STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</h2>
		<h3 id="sec4.1">4.1. 
		SWITZERLAND</h3>
		<p>4.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;	First, we would like to thank Director-General Okonjo-Iweala for her introductory remarks, and the Secretariat for having produced this new Report on trade-related developments.</p>
		<p>4.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;	This outstanding monitoring report offers once again a comprehensive picture of the situation, problems and challenges we are currently facing in the area of international trade almost two years since the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
		<h2 id="sec5">5. 
		CHAD ON BEHALF OF THE LDC GROUP</h2>
		<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Chair, yesterday we followed the launch of the Secretariat's study entitled "Easing Trade Bottlenecks in Landlocked Developing Countries".</p>
		<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	This morning, we followed with interest the launch of the third phase of the WTO Chairs Programme, which provides an opportunity not only to increase the awareness of the universities and academic and research institutions that inform our societies about international trade policy, but also to develop linkages with political decision-makers and officials responsible for formulating and implementing trade policy.</p>
		<p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Discussion is currently taking place on the report on developments in the international trading environment. It is clear that the WTO's multifaceted work, the relevance and coherence of which have been affirmed and which seeks to firmly establish the spirit of development through trade, is truly interesting.</p>
		<p>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;	On behalf of the group of least developed countries, I would like to congratulate the Secretariat and the Director-General and all her team for their commitment and for the efforts made to strengthen this multilateral trading system that is currently suffering a little.</p>
		<p>5.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;	The current pandemic is undoubtedly one of the greatest crises this century. Its social and economic effects are still visible. We are meeting at a critical juncture, with the pandemic in full swing. LDCs represent the low-income-country category, which is the most affected by the pandemic.</p>
		<p>5.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Given the lack of diversification in their economies, LDCs have seen a considerable decline in their market share. Inadequate health protection measures, disruption to national transport and supply systems and a lack of digitalization forced the majority of LDC enterprises to close during the pandemic. LDCs have seen a greater decline in exports of goods and services than the rest of the world: 16% for LDCs compared to 12% for the rest of the world in 2020. The pandemic brought the share of LDC exports in world trade down to 0.9% in 2020. All this paints a fairly gloomy picture for LDCs; their performance is suboptimal and the situation must be remedied. The contraction has left LDCs with little fiscal space to drive recovery. LDCs therefore need to further build their productive capacities so as to be able to diversify their production and export base, better integrate into global and regional value chains, generate employment, and lift their populations out of poverty.</p>
		<p>5.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Chair, allow me to conclude by saying that, given the importance of digital tools in today's world, we feel it would be appropriate for the WTO to help LDCs seize the opportunities provided by e-commerce so that they can be competitive in markets and meet their development goals. It is therefore necessary to facilitate our market access through technology transfer and to promote trade in our countries, which are the most vulnerable of all.</p>

		CHAIRPERSON'S CLOSING REMARKS</h2>
		<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;	I think this has been a constructive meeting and we have heard wide support for the transparency which this exercise offers. Overall, Members have responded quickly and cooperated constructively with the Secretariat to further enhance transparency around COVID‑19&nbsp;related trade measures as well as trade-related measures more generally.</p>
		<p>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Transparency and predictability are essential elements of a healthy and well-functioning international trading system – and more so when a situation changes rapidly and unpredictably. The ability of the monitoring exercise to deliver factual and up-to-date information depends, to a very large extent, on the input of Members. This includes, providing and verifying information which can only be obtained from you, the Members.</p>
		<p>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;	However, some regions remain underrepresented, and I would like to encourage those who have not been able to participate - to do so in the preparation of future reports.</p>
		<p>6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Your timely contributions to the Trade Monitoring Report and your support to the Secretariat is fundamental to ensure and preserve the high quality and accuracy of the reports.</p>
		<p>6.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;	Before I close the meeting, I would like to remind you that the next TPRB meeting will take place on 12&nbsp;and 14&nbsp;January&nbsp;2022&nbsp;when the TPRB will review Georgia's trade policies. I wish you all a restful end-year break. With those words, I hereby close this meeting. Thank you for your participation.</p>
